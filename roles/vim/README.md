The goal of this role is to document and configure vim. I want to also make it easy to customize. 

## Vim on Mac

```shell
brew install vim --with-python --with-ruby --with-perl

```

## Plugin Managers
I won't use any because it really shouldn't be necessary when e're controlling the config with ansible.  I will, however, use pathogen to manage the runtime path.
